# CS202 Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms
## Assignment 02 - Implementing a custom `vector` class and `sorter` class

### How to

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/sahilarora535/cs202-assignment02.git`, or download the zipped version and extract the contents.
2. Go the the repository folder in your local machine and run `make decompress` to decompress the input data. The dataset which will be generate in the `input` directory has to be used for diffent sorting algorithms to work upon.
3. To generate your own dataset, have a look at `generate_input.py` and edit accordingly. The file is written in `Python 3.6`.
